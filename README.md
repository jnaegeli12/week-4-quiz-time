# Week 4: Javascript Quiz
A timed JavaScript quiz with 6 questions.

## How to Play
The user clicks the "Start Quiz" button to begin the 90-second countdown timer and see the first question. Clicking the correct button advances the quiz to the next question. Clicking the incorrect button takes 15 seconds off the remaining time. Once all six questions have been answered correctly, the remaining time is the quiz score. The user is prompted to enter their initials, which is stored in local storage as the key to the value of the score.

## Things not quite working
I ran out of time to figure out how to pull the values from localstorage and display high scores.
